## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This is the source for the **Visual Novel Wiki**, a modern static wiki built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

The Visual Novel Wiki provides:

- **Guides** on:
  - How to run Visual Novels
  - Where to find Save Files (i.e., 100% CG)
  - Setting up Japanese tools such as Textractor
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - ... and more!
- **Compatibility List** for Windows, Linux, and Mac
- **Installation Guides** for different platforms

Future content may include:
- Walkthroughs
- VN Cheat guides (i.e., for RPG Maker)
- Translation resources

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **v23.11+**
- pnpm **v10.11+**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visual-novel-wiki.git
cd visual-novel-wiki

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start local dev server
pnpm dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Hot-loading is supported, so every time you make a change to a page (a `.md` file) or modify a component, it will update the page.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new guide, or improving the site functionality, your help is appreciated.

### Quick Start Guide

Here's where to add different types of content:

| Type of Contribution | Where to Add It |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| VN compatibility entry | Edit `docs/public/vn_list.json` |
| New wiki page | Add `.md` file to `docs/`. Please format as `your-visual-novel.md` (kebab-case) |
| Custom component | Add Vue component to `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` |
| Static assets | Put files in `docs/public/` |
| Site configuration | Modify `docs/.vitepress/config.js` |

### Referencing Files and Components

When writing content for the wiki, you'll need to reference various files and components:

#### Images and Static Assets
> [!NOTE]
> Images will be converted to `.webp` when merged-- please reference with `<img-name>.webp`

```md
<!-- Reference images from the public directory -->
![Logo](/logo.webp)
![Screenshot](/screenshots/install-guide.webp)

<!-- Link to downloadable files -->
[Download sample config](/configs/textractor-setup.zip)
```

#### Vue Components
Pages can literally embed Vue components, conveniently enough.

```md
<!-- Basic component usage -->
<DataTable jsonPath="'vn_list.json'" />
```

#### Internal Page Links
This uses the relative file path starting from your .md file.

Sometimes you need to go up or down a folder starting from the `.md` page to get to the correct `.md` page.

For example, here's our directory.

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started.md
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”œâ”€â”€ linux/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bottles/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bottles-compatibility-list.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.md
â”œâ”€â”€ android/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kirikiroid2.md # For example, starting from here.
â”œâ”€â”€ all-platforms/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ textractor.md # Let's reference this page.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ steam.md
â””â”€â”€ visual-novels/
    â”œâ”€â”€ fate-stay-night.md
    â””â”€â”€ steins-gate.md
```

If we started from `docs/android/kirikiroid2.md`, and want to reference `docs/all-platforms/textractor.md` in our page:

```md
docs/android/kirikiroid2.md -> docs/all-platforms/textractor.md

See our [Textractor](../all-platforms/textractor.md) for more details.

```
