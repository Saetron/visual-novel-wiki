Most of the time, the Japanese save files do work with the English version.

To use the website:

1. Find the Japanese name of your visual novel — usually by searching [vndb](https://vndb.org).
2. Go to the website.
3. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> on Mac) to open the search bar.
4. Search using the **first letter** of the visual novel’s Japanese name.

Most visual novels have a dedicated save folder. Usually drag and drop / replace files.
