# Linux & Steam Deck

## Getting Started

### Steam Deck

To run _most_ Visual Novels, you need to setup:

1. [Lutris (front-end like Steam)](lutris#steam-deck)
2. Enable Japanese Locale

After doing those two, you _can_ run most visual novels.

Granted, some VNs have quirks. See the [Visual Novel Compatibility List](../visual-novel-compatibility-list) to see if it runs.
